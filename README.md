# LR2Unrandomizer
This plugin allows you to specify random lane patterns and use r-random in LR2. See the config file for usage. 
Since g-battling IR top scores to obtain competetive scores is considered by many a legitimate strategy, this plugin is made to simplify the process. If a lane pattern can be obtained through g-battle, it will be allowed in game. Otherwise the plugin will not do anything. 
Specification with f-ran is not allowed. 5k is currently not supported, but might be as demands rise. 

Feature:
Keeps the correct randseed for specified pattern in replay files and IR entries.
